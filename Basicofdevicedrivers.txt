firstly I created a c file then written a code for kernel then compile that file 

so I got .ko file that file is kernel object or module now I will inject that into the kernel 
then that file will verfify


now we have to print kernel log buffer 


function I create in the c file enter the function hello world the name of function is constructor


exit function is used to say distructor


// what is device tree in kernel && make default the driver pele se hi load hona chaiye 

// install kernel linux into the raspberry pi

installstion of kernel in the raspberrypi then want instert the new kernel again through the cross complation
